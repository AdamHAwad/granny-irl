# üîê Mobile OAuth Authentication Fix

## Problem
When users click "Sign in with Google" in the mobile app, they get redirected to Chrome browser instead of staying within the app. After signing in via Chrome, the authentication doesn't transfer back to the mobile app.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **App State Monitoring**
- Added listener for when app returns to foreground
- Automatically checks authentication state when user returns from browser
- If user signed in via browser, the app will detect and apply the session

### 2. **Custom URL Scheme Support** 
- Added `com.grannyirl.app://oauth/callback` URL scheme to Android manifest
- Configured intent filters to handle OAuth callbacks
- Added deep link listener in AuthContext

### 3. **Enhanced Mobile Detection**
- AuthContext now detects when running on mobile vs web
- Uses appropriate OAuth handling for each platform
- Maintains cross-platform compatibility

## Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario 1: OAuth with App State Detection
1. Open the mobile app
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Sign in via Chrome browser (as currently happens)
4. **Return to the mobile app** by switching back via recent apps
5. **Expected**: App should automatically detect you're signed in and update UI

### Test Scenario 2: Deep Link Handling
1. Open the mobile app
2. Click "Sign in with Google" 
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. **Expected**: Should redirect back to app via custom URL scheme
5. **Expected**: App should handle the callback and sign user in

## Files Modified

### `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added mobile service integration
- Added app state change listener
- Added deep link URL handler
- Enhanced OAuth flow for mobile detection

### `/lib/mobileService.ts`  
- Added `@capacitor/browser` plugin import
- Added `onAppStateChange()` method
- Added `onUrlChange()` for deep links
- Added `openOAuthUrl()` for controlled OAuth flows

### `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Added intent filter for custom URL scheme
- Configured OAuth callback handling

### `/capacitor.config.ts`
- Added Browser plugin configuration
- Set presentation style to 'popover'

## Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" 
2. Opens Chrome browser
3. User signs in
4. Stays in Chrome browser
5. ‚ùå User not signed into mobile app

**After Fix:**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Opens Chrome browser (or in-app browser)
3. User signs in
4. Either:
   - Returns to app via deep link (ideal)
   - User manually switches back to app
5. ‚úÖ App detects authentication and signs user in

## Troubleshooting

### If OAuth Still Opens Chrome
- This is expected behavior initially
- The key improvement is that returning to the app should complete the sign-in

### If App Doesn't Detect Sign-in After Returning
- Check console logs for "App became active" messages
- Check console logs for "Found new session after app resumed"
- Ensure mobile app is built with latest changes: `npx cap sync android`

### For Advanced Debugging
Add these console logs to track the flow:
```typescript
// In AuthContext.tsx, add more detailed logging
console.log('Auth state check:', { user: !!user, session: !!session });
```

## Alternative Solutions (If Current Fix Insufficient)

### Option A: In-App Browser
- Use Capacitor Browser plugin to open OAuth in app overlay
- Requires additional URL monitoring and session extraction

### Option B: Native Google Sign-In
- Install `@capacitor-community/google-auth` plugin
- Implement native Google authentication flow
- More complex but better UX

### Option C: Custom Auth Page
- Create mobile-specific auth page
- Handle OAuth entirely within app webview
- Requires backend modifications

**Status**: ‚úÖ OAuth fix implemented and ready for testing  
**Next Steps**: Test the mobile app OAuth flow and verify authentication works
